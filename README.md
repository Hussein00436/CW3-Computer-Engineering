For this Coursework we divided the the task on the 3 of us where () was in charge of importing all classes needed and creating a function of our own implementation and giving user inputs. () was in charge of the robots navigation using sensors and by creating a path that the robot follows using curve fitting and plotting it on the map. () was in charge of creating a nested loop over the length of the points along the path and then we have the while loop that allows the vehicle to reach the consecutive point to whichever point it is currently located at, also he was in charge of importing a matrix map.
The user inputs that were given is for the robot's initial position, how many obstacles are in the way, the angle the robot moves with, and the robot's goal. The expected output are sensors readings as the robot is moving it detects an obsatcle and sends its x and y coordinates to avoid it.
Softwares that were used in this project were vscode, robotictoolbox(rtb), 
The code should be able to accept user inputs for the initial position and the goal, calculating and updating the robot's position on the map using sensors, reaching the required goal as fast and efficient as possible without colliding with the walls or obstacles
